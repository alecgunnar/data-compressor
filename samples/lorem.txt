It's quite difficult to invent a random code or string: this utility may help. Generating a random code is not an easy task for a computer that can only execute sequential ant totally reproducible code. To generate random numbers, pseudo-random generators are used: if correctly designed, they produce numbers with a good probability distribution (every number generated is equally probable), but they are highly predictable since the generated numbers are not random but are part of a long and well defined sequence. To make sure the generated codes cannot be predicted, some real randomness should be included. In this calculator, we use the mouse-clicks one makes on the rectangle below to increase the randomness. Of course, if one could access or see the screen when the clicks take place, it would have some more clues to guess the code, but let's assume that the operation of clicking is done in a good privacy. It should also be stressed that this script is executed locally in the browser and that there is no communication on the network. Since the code displayed is not sent over the network, it cannot be easily sniffed by a third party. So, this calculator works in two steps: first you click in the rectangle enough times to collect random data, than you select the format you need and hit the "calculate" button. The algorithm is designed in such a way that every mouse-click generates the required randomness to generate two characters.
